        Hi, I&apos;m Jagdish Choudhary, a Third-year Electronics &
        Telecommunication Engineering student passionate about building smart,
        scalable tech solutions that bridge hardware and software. I specialize
        in C++, JavaScript, and full-stack web development, currently working
        with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). I&apos;m also
        experienced with ESP32/ESP8266, sensor integration, Firebase, and
        real-time IoT systems. üõ†Ô∏è My key projects include: IoT-Based Smart
        Street Light System : Real-time city-wide light monitoring with Firebase
        + ESP8266. Energy Monitoring Meter : Tracks energy usage and cost trends
        via a web dashboard (Next.js + Tailwind + MongoDB). 12-Channel
        Remote-Controlled Drone : Custom PCB + Arduino Nano + NRF24L01 +
        MPU6050. E-Commerce Website : End-to-end responsive store with
        authentication and cart system. Smart Waste Segregator & Gas Leak
        Detector using Arduino üí° I always like exploring the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù behind
        systems, love diving into DSA, and stay hands-on with electronics and
        real-world problem-solving. My learning pace is fast, and I thrive in
        collaborative, innovation-driven environments.
